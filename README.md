# Analysis of the Product line and sales statistics of a large company.
I created a Dynamic-Sales-dashboard using Google sheets to properly understand a large company's Product line sales statistics.
First i had to clean the dataset, which included checking for duplicates and misspellings.
Then I primarily used Pivot tables to group my columns of interest then i added charts to visualize some of these contexts.
